Here's my open source implementation of the SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 secure has algorithms. It's released under an open source BSD license. The README contained in the tarball below is included later on this page. The tarball contains seven files, the README file, the SHA-1/224/256/384/512 implementation in two files, sha2.c and sha2.h, and several utility programs, sha2test.pl and mktestdata.pl (two perl scripts for testing to make sure the library is working correctly and comparing with known test vectors), sha2speed.c (to test how fast the implementation is working), and sha2prog.c, a utility that uses the library to generate SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 hashes from either standard input, or from a file.
