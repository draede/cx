TinyMT is a new small-sized variant of Mersenne Twister (MT) introduced by Mutsuo Saito and Makoto Matsumoto in 2011. 
There are two types of TinyMT, tinymt32 and tinymt64. tinymt32 outputs 32-bit unsigned integers and single precision 
floating point numbers. On the other hand, tinymt64 outputs 64-bit unsigned integers and double precision floating 
point numbers.
