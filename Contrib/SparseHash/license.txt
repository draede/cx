This directory contains several hash-map implementations, similar in
API to SGI's hash_map class, but with different performance
characteristics.  sparse_hash_map uses very little space overhead, 1-2
bits per entry.  dense_hash_map is very fast, particulary on lookup.
(sparse_hash_set and dense_hash_set are the set versions of these
routines.)  On the other hand, these classes have requirements that
may not make them appropriate for all applications.

All these implementation use a hashtable with internal quadratic
probing.  This method is space-efficient -- there is no pointer
overhead -- and time-efficient for good hash functions.
